# `Problem`

Given anÂ `m x n`Â `board`Â of characters and a list of stringsÂ `words`, returnÂ *all words on the board*.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, whereÂ **adjacent cells**Â are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []

```

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `board[i][j]`Â is a lowercase English letter.
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]`Â consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings ofÂ `words`Â are unique.
