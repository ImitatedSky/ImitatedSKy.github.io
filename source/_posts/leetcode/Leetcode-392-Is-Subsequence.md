# `Problem`

Given two stringsÂ `s`Â andÂ `t`, returnÂ `true`Â *if*Â `s`Â *is aÂ **subsequence**Â of*Â `t`*, or*Â `false`Â *otherwise*.

AÂ **subsequence**Â of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e.,Â `"ace"`Â is a subsequence ofÂ `"abcde"`Â whileÂ `"aec"`Â is not).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 104`
- `s`Â andÂ `t`Â consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:**

Suppose there are lots of incoming

```
s
```

, say

```
s1, s2, ..., sk
```

where

```
k >= 10^9
```

, and you want to check one by one to see if

```
t
```

has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

# `Solve`

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        j = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in t[j:]:
                return False
            else:
                j = j + t[j:].index(s[i]) +1

        return True
```

            else:
                ii = t.index(s[i])
