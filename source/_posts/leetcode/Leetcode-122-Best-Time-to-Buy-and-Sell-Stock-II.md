# `Problem`

You are given an integer arrayÂ `prices`Â whereÂ `prices[i]`Â is the price of a given stock on theÂ `ith`Â day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only holdÂ **at most one**Â share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on theÂ **same day**.

Find and returnÂ *theÂ **maximum**Â profit you can achieve*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
