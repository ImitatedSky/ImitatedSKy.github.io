# `Problem`

You are given an integer arrayÂ `coins`Â representing coins of different denominations and an integerÂ `amount`Â representing a total amount of money.

ReturnÂ *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, returnÂ `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 104`

# `Solve`

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:

        dp = [ amount + 1 ]*(amount + 1)

        dp[0] = 0

        for i in range( amount+1 ):
            for coin in coins:
                if i - coin >= 0:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i] , 1 + dp[ i - coin ])
        
        if dp[ amount ] == amount + 1:
            return -1
        
        return dp[amount]
        
```
