# `Problem`

In this problem, a tree is anÂ **undirected graph**Â that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree withÂ `n`Â nodes labeled fromÂ `1`Â toÂ `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has twoÂ **different**Â vertices chosen fromÂ `1`Â toÂ `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an arrayÂ `edges`Â of lengthÂ `n`Â whereÂ `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`Â indicates that there is an edge between nodesÂ `ai`Â andÂ `bi`Â in the graph.

ReturnÂ *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of*Â `n`Â *nodes*. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]

```

**Example 2:**

!https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == edges.length`
- `3 <= n <= 1000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length`
- `ai != bi`
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

# `Solve`

```python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

        n = len(edges)
        
        parent = [-1]*( len(edges) + 1 )

        def find(u):
            if parent[u] == -1:
                return u
            
            return find(parent[u])

        def union(u,v):

            u_p = find(u)
            v_p = find(v)

            if u_p != v_p:
                parent[v_p] = u_p

                return False
            else:

                return True

        for i in range(len(edges)):
            if  union( edges[i][0] , edges[i][1] )  :

                return [ edges[i][0] , edges[i][1]   ]
